The TV image does not look as good as it did in the store. Store displays are all tuned to digital, HD (high definition) channels. If you have an analog cable/set top box, upgrade to a digital set top box. Use HDMI or Component cables to deliver HD (high definition) picture quality. Many HD channels are upscaled from SD (Standard Definition) content. Look for a channel that is broadcasting true HD content. ● Cable/Satellite Subscribers: Try HD channels from the channel lineup. ● Air/Cable Antenna Connection: Try HD channels after running the Auto Program function. Adjust the cable or satellite box's video output resolution to 1080i or 720p. The picture is distorted. The compression of video content may cause picture distortions, especially in fast moving pictures from sports programs and action movies. A weak or bad quality signal can cause picture distortions. This is not an issue with the TV. Mobile phones used close to the TV (within 3.2 ft) may cause noise in analog and digital channels. The color is wrong or missing. If you're using a Component connection, make sure that the Component cables are connected to the correct jacks. Incorrect or loose connections may cause color problems or a blank screen. The color is poor or the picture is not bright enough. Go to the Picture menu and then adjust the Picture Mode , Brightness , Sharpness , and Color settings. See if Energy Saving (( MENU/123 ) MENU System Eco Solution Energy Saving ) has been enabled. Try resetting the picture. ( Picture Picture Reset ) There is a dotted line on the edge of the screen. Change Picture Size to 16:9 . The picture is black and white. If you are using AV composite input, connect the video cable (yellow) to the TV's green component jack. \" If the test picture does not appear or there is noise or distortion, the TV may have a problem. Contact Samsung's Call Center for assistance. \" If the test picture is displayed properly, there may be a problem with an external device. Please check the connections. \" If the problem persists, check the signal strength or refer to the external device's user manual."

Use only a soft cloth such as superfine fibers or cotton flannels to clean the glasses as the surface and the lenses easily crack. Because the glasses can be easily scratched by foreign substances, make sure to dust off the cloth before using. ● Do not disassemble, or attempt to repair or modify your 3D active glasses by yourself. ● Be careful not to let the temple ends of the 3D active glasses harm your eye. ● Do not sleep with the 3D glasses on. You can break the arms. ● Use your hands to put on or remove the 3D glasses. ● For SSG-5100 and SSG-5150 model glasses, use only the specified standard batteries. When replacing the battery, insert the battery so that its polarity (+, -) is correct. Failing to do so may damage the battery or result in fire, personal injury or environmental damage caused by liquid leaking from the battery. ● For SSG-5100 and SSG-5150 model glasses, keep used batteries out of the reach of children so that they do not accidently swallow it. If your child swallows a battery, consult your doctor immediately. ● Swallowing the cylindrical (button type) battery can cause serious damage to your internal organs. If this happens, contact a doctor immediately."

          "text":"● 480i / 480p / 720p / 1080i / 1080p Generally refers to the number of effective scanning lines that determines the screen's resolution. There are two scanning methods: interlaced and progressive. - Scanning Sequential projection of pixels to form images. The higher the number of pixels, the clearer and more vivid the images. - Progressive A sequential scanning method that scans every line, one after another. - Interlaced A staggered scanning method that scans every other line until the end of the screen and then fills in the remaining lines. Example) If the number of horizontal scan lines is 480i Scans 240 lines from start to finish and then scans the remaining 240 lines for a total of 480 lines. * General differences between 480i and 480p are as follows: 480i 480p Horizontal Frequency 15.75Khz 31.5Khz FPS 30 60 Lines on Screen 480 480 ● ARC (Audio Return Channel) ARC lets the TV output digital sound to an audio device and input digital sound from the same audio device through one HDMI cable. However, ARC is only available through the HDMI (ARC) port and only when the TV is connected to an ARC-enabled AV receiver. ● DVI (Digital Visual Interface) Connecting the TV's DVI connector to a computer's DVI connector via an HDMI-to-DVI cable lets you use the TV as a computer monitor. However, HDMI-to-DVI cables deliver video signals only. You must connect a set of speakers to the computer using a separate cable to hear the computer's audio. ● HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) HDMI is a method of transmitting both video and audio signals via a single cable. ● Dynamic versus Static IP Addresses If the network requires a dynamic IP address, use an ADSL modem or router that supports the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Modems and routers that support DHCP automatically provide the IP address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS values the TV needs to access the Internet, so they do not have to be entered manually. Most home networks use a dynamic IP address. If the network requires a static IP address, enter the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS values manually when setting up the network connection. To get the IP address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS values, contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If the network requires a static IP address, use an ADSL modem that supports DHCP. ADSL modems that support DHCP also allow static IP addresses. ● Bluetooth Bluetooth is a short-distance wireless communication protocol allowing information exchange between connected Bluetooth compatible mobile phones, laptops, earphones and headphones. It is mostly used for low-power wireless connections within a distance of 32.8 ft. ● Ethernet Ethernet is a LAN (Local Area Network) that uses coaxial cables standardized by the IEEE. ● Component Connection Component connections are mostly used for game consoles and transmit the video signal by splitting it into a luminance signal (Y) and two color signals (Pb and Pr). The connector is marked as [Component IN]_(Pr, Pb, Y) on the back of the TV. On some devices, it is sometimes marked as Cr, Cb, Y. Cb and Cr are the digital conversions of the Pb and Pr signals. The connectors are normally color-coded red (R), blue (B), and green (G) and offer the best picture quality possible for an analog connection."
